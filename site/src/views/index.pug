  'Room Bookings':'We are currently working on the room bookings API, initially allowing read access to expose data such as what rooms there are and when they are available before adding the ability to book rooms through the API as well.',
  '3rd Party Authentication':'The goal with this is to make authenticating people using their UCL credentials much easier for 3rd party developers.',
  'Maps':'There is already very detailed data about the location of most of the rooms in UCL. We want to make this data available so people can have better directions in their apps and services.',
  'Moodle':'We want to make it much easier to access the data available on moodle such as grades, slides and notes.'

        p To create a ridiculously simple, documentation first API based around UCLs digital
          services and to establish an eco system of third party apps and services that utilise
          the API in ways we could never imagine, improving the lives of everyone at UCL for years to come.
